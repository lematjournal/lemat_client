# Le Mat Journal

A project to democratize the curatorial and editorial process inspired by Jacques Ranciere's theory of aesthetic politics and Francois Laruelle's non-philosophy project.

## The Concept

An artistic/academic "do-ocracy" where anyone can be an editor. Artists, writers and the editors themselves submit their pieces to the journal, when enough pieces accumulate editors will vote on submissions. Voting requires leaving a comment, providing adequate reason for the vote. Comments are moderated by an admin (a rotating position) to ensure that fair reasons are given. Voting will take place within a limited time frame, if time elapses then editors who didn't vote lose a small percentage of their voting power. Editor's voting weight is determined by participation in voting cycles, so if an editor is absent through several voting blocks the wieght of their vote decreases. Voting power can be increased to 100% again by participation. In a given voting cycle, an editor will have the weight of their vote increased to 150% to allow editors an opportunity to highlight their tastes in a given issue.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
