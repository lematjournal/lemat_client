# Le Mat Journal

A project to democratize the curatorial and editorial process inspired by Jacques Ranciere's theory of aesthetic politics and Francois Laruelle's non-philosophy project.

## The Concept

A theory/art journal "do-ocracy" where anyone can be an editor. Artists, writers and the editors themselves submit their pieces to the journal. When enough pieces accumulate editors will vote on submissions.

The basic idea is that it is easy to participate in the voting process and the longer one stays involved the more their vote counts. Voting takes place in the span of a few weeks. Editor's voting weight is determined by participation in previous voting cycles and increases slightly overtime. Periodically, an editor will have the weight of their vote doubled to allow editors an opportunity to highlight their tastes and showcase their work in a given issue.

## Technical Shit

Angular 1 app recently refactored to es6 and "componentized" in a React inspired style in an attempt to prepare for Angular 2.

## Build & development

Run `gulp build` for building and `gulp watch` for preview.

## Testing

Uninstalled test suite after refactor. Tests coming soon.
